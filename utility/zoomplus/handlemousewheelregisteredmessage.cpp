File:	HandleMouseWheelRegisteredMessage.cpp
Owner:	russf@gipsysoft.com
Purpose:	Functon to handle the regsitered message associated with the
					mouse wheel. This will simply re-package the message and send
					it on to the main window as a WM_MOUSEWHEEL. This code originated
					in from MFC source code, and then I made it better.
