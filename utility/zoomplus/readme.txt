What can Zoom+ do?
------------------
Zoom+ is a general screen magnification tool. It can magnify any portion of
the screen by up to 32 times. Panning around, zooming in  or out.

Icon Thief
It provides software developers and web designers with an easy method of
grabbing screen elements such as toolbar buttons and icons from running
programs or web sites. Simply zoom in on the are you are interested in and
copy the view to the clipboard, or for more precision, click the right
mouse button on the Zoom+ window and drag a selection rectangle. When you
release the right mouse button you can copy a selection of the screen to
the clipboard.

Pixel Counting
Zoom+ also adds easy pixel counting by giving a selection marquee when the
right mouse button is dragged on the main window. This selection can then
be copied to clipboard or saved to file. Whilst the selection marquee is
displayed a tool tip of the selection dimensions is displayed.

Status Bar
The status bar displays really useful information such as the colour beneath
the pointer, in both a colour panel and as RGB. There is also a panel that
displays the current mouse coordinates in either screen coordinates or coordinates
relative to the client area of the window beneath the cursor. The colour format
and the coordinate choice can be changed from the options dialog or from the
context menu on the colour panel.

Grid
An overlay grid allows for quick sizing and alignment of screen elements, the
grid size and colour can be changed from the options dialog available from the
main context menu or from the system menu. You can toggle the grid on and off
by using the tool bar button or a shortcut key.

Context Menus
Context menus provide context sensitive choices. The status bar colour and
coordinates panels have their own context menu and the main display has one for
just right clicking on the display and one for when you right-drag on the main display.

Other
To maximise your screen usage you can switch off the toolbar and status from the main
context menu. All toolbar features are available from either the main context menu or
from keyboard shortcuts.
Intellimouse support means you can zoom in and out using CTRL+Mouse Wheel, plus
MS Internet Explorer style panning is supported simply by clicking the middle mouse
button

Context Help
Zoom+ has full help throughout, try right clicking on the tool bar or status bar
and selecting What’s This from the context menu. There is full context help in the
options dialog too.




Why would you want it? 
----------------------
Zoom+ is a useful tool to have if you are writing any Windows controls, designing
graphics and icons, writing any drawing code or are just curious how an application
has achieved an interesting effect with so few pixels and colours.

I personally use Zoom+ when I am writing controls/drawing code to ensure my code is
accurate. I also use Zoom+ when I want to copy a toolbar bitmap from a running
application and paste just the small image into the toolbar editor (rather than
having to cut out the tiny bitmap I need from a large window/screen grab bitmap).

I use the follow mouse feature most because it is less CPU intensive and I have it
'on top' pretty much permanently. I love the fact that Zoom+ remembers it's settings
from one session to the next, it means that once I have set it up to watch an area of
the display I can open and close it without losing the settings.

Features
--------
* Magnify any portion of the screen up to 32 times. 
* No more pixel counting. Whenever you make a selection with Zoom+ the size of
  the selection in screen pixels is displayed in a tooltip style popup window. 
* The overlay grid allow instant alignment and pixel counting. The colour of
  the grid and the density of the grid are both user defineable. 
* Intellimouse support for data-zoom, that is hold down the CTRL key whilst
  pushing the mouse wheel forwards and backwards.
* Internet Explorer style auto-panning. Simply click the middle mouse button
  on the main Zoom+ display and you can pan around the entire screen. 
* Full keyboard support. 
* Always on top - this allows Zoom+ to remain floating above all other
  applications. 
* Copy to clipboard - both the zoomed image and the screen image can be copied
  to the clipboard. 
* Save to file support - both the zoomed image and the screen image can be saved
  to an uncompressed Windows bitmap, this file can then be loaded and edited using
  an image editor such as Microsoft Paint. 
* Follow mouse - allows Zoom+ to update the display every time the mouse moves.
  This is useful when inspecting areas of the screen that may be animated or where
  you are not really sure where the area of interest may be. 
* Advanced screen grabbing feature allows any portion of the screen to be easily
  saved to the clipboard or file.
* Highlight - sometimes it is not obvious which area of the screen you are magnifying,
  highlight will cause the magnified screen rectangle to flash several times. 
* Zoom To - enables you to easily zoom in on the area of interest; just select the
  area you want by holding down the right mouse button and dragging, and choose Zoom
  To from the context menu. 
* Zoom+ remembers all of your settings and preferences and has an exceptionally
  small footprint. 
* Status bar shows RGB or hexadecimal value at the cursor, the actual colour at the
  cursor and the current cursor position. 
* Status bar shows the mouse cursor position, either relative to the screen to
  relative to the client are of the window beneath the cursor.
* Transparent window in Windows 2000 or above.
