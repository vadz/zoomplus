Zoom+ Change History
--------------------
List of changes and remarks for the various versions of Zoom+

1.8
Added system hotkeys (configurable in the options) to copy the colour OR the bitmap to the clipboard.

1.7
In follow mouse mode when the cursor is showing it will now optionlly display the operating system cursor. Change it in the options dialog.
  I also updated the help for this...once I remembered how ;-)

1.6
Added a toolbar button to show the options. I wish I could draw icons though ;-)
Added ability to correct the window position when changing screen sizes. This was annoying because I was testing other software
  when dealing with the absence of a second monitor and Z+ of course remember it's screen position
Change the source code to explicitly use the WinHelper namespace so parts of the code can be more easily used in MFC applications
Added a tip for when the user mouse downs on the Zoom+ display - helps novice users that don't know what to do.
Changed the default window to be a bit bigger
Changed project settings so paths for LIB and include are not needed.

1.5c
Added statusbar text when left clicking to encourage user to move the mouse.
Added a hyperlink to status bar.
Added tooltips to the statusbar panels to encourage use of them.
When displaying a hyperlink I now use the system 'hand' cursor if it can be loaded, if not then I use my own hand cursor.

1.5b
Small performance enhancement by moving the LoadCursor out of the draw loop when in follow
	mouse mode.

1.5a
Added a transparency option. This only works on Windows 200 but when it works it works
	just great. With transparency switched on there is a really cool side-effect that allows
	you to watch the windows beneath Zoom+. Is that great!
	There is a menu option, a shortcut key to toggle it and you can use the mouse wheel+SHIFT
		to alter the transparency.

1.5
Fixed issues with multim-monitor support so Z+ now works just great with multiple
	monitors
Fixed a couple of minor bugs including the bug where the hex colour value was shown
	incorrectly.
Added icon to the selection tip to make it look nicer.
Added a different cursor when left-dragging.
Bumped up the font size in the help file and fixed some typos.
Removed the shareware crap. Shareware doesn't work and I have decided that Z+ should be free
	anyway. And I have also decided to ship the source code with it too - if you want it that
	is.

1.4
Fixed problem working on NT5(Windows 2000) in that the toolbar was not displaying flat.
Added an overlay grid, with use defined size and colour, this should basically
	finish the pixel counting.
Added the ability to toggle the coordintes in the status bar between screen and window client
	coordinates. This makes it easier to see where the mouse is within a window.
Added extra context menus to the colour and coordinate panels in the status bar, this means you 
	no longer have to go to the options dialog box to change the panel settings.
Numerous changes to the help.
Removed About and Help from the main context menu because it was too big.
Added a shortcut for the highlight feature (CTRL+H)

1.3
Fixed a minor memory leak and added status bar help text to the Highlight command.
Fixed a minor pixel out on the options dialog.
Added Intellimouse style panning window. This allows the user to middle button down and
	to move the mouse away from the origin window. Code in OWnd.DLL is dynamically loaded
	so if the DLL goes missing the core functionality remains intact.
Fixed slight weirdness when using the Zoom To Selection feature where it was only using
  the width to determine the new zoom level.
Changed the selection rectangle to be a marquee, this makes it easier to see than the
  inverted rectangle.

1.2
Added a status bar. This contains the usual "F1 for Help", plus it contains a colour
  panel showing the actual colour at the mouse point, the RGB value at the mouse
  point and the current cursor coordinates.
Added an Options dialog. Options include the ability to define Slow, Medium and Fast
  update speeds. Ability to switch off the mouse cursor display when Follow Mouse
  is on, and the ability to ensure only one instance of Zoom+ is running.
Added Right Drag feature. This makes the program really useful -- gives Zoom+ the ability
  to mark a rectangle on the zoom display. When right drag is complete (and right
  button released) a context menu appears giving the choice of saving the selection
  to file or copying the selection to the clipboard.
Added "Zoom To" to zoom to the selected area of Zoom+, an extension of the right drag
  feature.
Added Highlight feature to flash where the zoom rectangle is on the screen should you
  have happened to lose it.
Added nag screen as per WinZip. Not too offensive I think but hopefully enough to remind
  of Zoom+ being Shareware.

1.1
Fixed stoopid fatal flaw.


1.0	(Some sites issued it as 1.1 for some reason.)
Release with one major flaw, I did not test it properly on basic systems and therefore
  when the program started, it would fail to find a function in a DLL.
