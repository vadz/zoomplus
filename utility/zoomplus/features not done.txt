----------------------------

List of features I would like to have done but just can't find the energy to go ahead
with them. Still, getting to version 1.8 is pretty good I guess.


Follow Focus.
-------------
Similar thing to Follow Cursor, except we would follow the focus instead, I guess
we would simply call GetFocus and zoom on the centre of that window. I guess even the
the fact that we zoom on the centre of the window would be configurable, would it
be the centre or the top left of each window, or would we try to zoom out to include
the entire window? all configurable I guess.


Timed capture
-------------
Start and stop capturing the image to file.


Bitmap Menus
------------
Change the context menu to be an office like bitmap menu. Also add the pager control to the toolbar.


Close/Minmise to the tray.
--------------------
Close and minimise just closes Zoom+ to the system tray. 


AppBar Zoom+
------------
Attaches itself to the desktop or becomes part of the toolbars we have on the desktop.


Tooltips in status bar
----------------------
Simple tool tip describing the content of each panel in the status bar.


Misc.
=====
Context help in all dialogs
Option to choose whether to zoom to, copy original etc, when release right mouse button.
